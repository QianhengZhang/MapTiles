## 1. Introduction to the Map Tiles

This work includes one map with 4 layers. The first 3 layers are map tiles generated by Map box and QGIS relating to the historical landslide locations in Seattle. And the last map tile is a creative work basing on theme of book culture. I got the idea of making it from covers of books. Users can switch between the layers using the buttons on the side.

In addition, users can adjust the zoom level for as accurate as 8-12. There are scale bar on the side of the page showing current zoom level. And users can zoom in and out by the tool on the top-right corner.

### Tile 1: Monochrome Basemap

This is a basic base map tile sets generated by Mapbox studio and I changed the fonts of it to show the name of cities clearer. The min and max of zoom level is 8 and 12.

### Tile 2: Seattle Historical Landslide Locations Map

This is a thematic layer map tile sets using data from Seattle GeoData portal. The locations of each landslide incident are recored and represented in the form of dark blue dots. The base map here is the main base map of the page which means it's the lowest layer. And the base map is also provided by Mapbox.The min and max of zoom level is 8 and 12.

### Tile 3: Combining the 2 Tiles

This is the combination of first two map tiles which shows the landslide locations on the basemap. Dark blue color dots are clear to see for the audience with the light blue background color. The min and max of zoom level is 8 and 12.


### Tile 4: Book Culture Style Map

This is the customized map tile I made for my project book culture in Washington State. I want to represent the culture by making the base color looks like a book cover and I highlighted all schools with deep brown. The water body's dark blue is contrasting to the orange and gives a perfect impression on the book culture. The min and max of zoom level is 8 and 12.
